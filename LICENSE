Human-Scale Source License
Version 1.2

Copyright (c) 2025 Pete Jensen

This software is published openly, but not without boundaries.
It is intended for human-scale builders, researchers, and independent
developers, not for institutional extraction or enclosure.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any individual,
student, researcher, independent developer, or organization with
fewer than ten (10) employees and less than one million
(1,000,000) USD in annual revenue (“Permitted Users”), to use,
copy, modify, and redistribute this software and its associated
documentation files (the “Software”), subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below.

This license is source-available. It is not an open-source license
as defined by the Open Source Initiative.

1. Restrictions

1.1 Institutional and Corporate Use

Any company, organization, or entity that does not qualify as a
Permitted User is not authorized to use, copy, modify, distribute,
or integrate the Software without first obtaining a separate
commercial license from the copyright holder.

Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, internal tooling,
dependencies, evaluation, research use, or silent adoption.

1.2 Proprietary and Closed Systems

The Software may not be incorporated into, linked with, or used as
part of any proprietary, closed-source, paywalled, or access-
restricted product, platform, or service without a commercial
license.

Systems that deny users the ability to inspect, audit, or modify
their operational code are considered closed systems under this
license.

1.3 Third-Party Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Use

Except where unavoidable due to the terms of a public hosting
platform, the Software, including its source code, structure,
documentation, or outputs, may not be used to train, fine-tune,
evaluate, distill, or otherwise improve proprietary or closed-
source machine learning or artificial intelligence models without
a commercial license.

This restriction applies solely to activities that modify, enhance,
or improve the underlying model itself.

Use of the Software by machine learning or artificial intelligence
systems at inference time — including use by autonomous or semi-
autonomous coding agents to read, execute, generate, or reason
about code — is expressly permitted.

For the avoidance of doubt, this restriction does not apply to
incidental data, logs, traces, telemetry, or other exhaust
generated as a byproduct of lawful runtime use of the Software by
machine learning or artificial intelligence systems, where such
data is captured or processed under the terms of an external
platform or service.

This license governs deliberate reuse and intentional ingestion
of the Software itself, not ambient byproducts of execution beyond
the author’s control.

1.4 Hosted Services and Software-as-a-Service

The Software may not be offered, in whole or in part, as a paid
hosted service, software-as-a-service (SaaS), managed service, or
commercial API without a commercial license.

Repackaging, abstraction, partial integration, or orchestration
does not alter this requirement.

2. Redistribution

Redistributions of the Software, whether modified or unmodified,
must retain this license and all copyright notices. The Software
may not be relicensed or redistributed under different terms.

3. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

4. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

5. Commercial Licensing

Entities wishing to use the Software outside the scope of this
license must obtain a commercial license directly from the
copyright holder.

This license reflects an intent to preserve openness at human
scale, permit agentic use, and resist silent capture, opaque
reuse, and unaccountable extraction.
